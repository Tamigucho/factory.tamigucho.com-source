Regions like Kalos, Galar and Paldea (data/regions.json) have only one game instead of more, so arrays shouldn't be expected from them. Please fix that in components/RegionPage.js.








The issue you're facing is due to the fact that some regions have only one game associated with them, and this game is not wrapped in an array in the regions.json file. This causes an error in the RegionPage.js component when it tries to map over the region.games property, expecting it to be an array.

To fix this, you can ensure that region.games is always an array before trying to map over it. You can do this by wrapping region.games in Array.isArray() function to check if it's an array. If it's not, you can convert it into an array using square brackets [].

Here's how you can modify the RegionPage.js component:

const RegionPage = () => {
  const { regionName } = useParams();
  const region = regionsData.find(region => region.name === regionName);

  // Ensure region.games is always an array
  const games = Array.isArray(region.games) ? region.games : [region.games];

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{region.name}</h2>
      <h3>Games <span className="badge bg-secondary" title={`Set in the ${region.name} region: ${games.length} games`}>{games.length}</span></h3>
      <ul>
        {games.map(game => <li key={game}>{game}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};


This change ensures that the games variable is always an array, whether the region.games property is a single string or an array of strings. This way, the .map() function will always work correctly.









Okay, now RegionPage is working for all regions.

However, in RegionsList.js, from Unova to Paldea, the games badge count is wrong, compared to the badge shown in RegionPage.js in the <h2>.

From Kanto to Sinnoh it is correct, matching the badge in <h2> in these regions' pages.

But Unova says 0 games (while in its page <h2> badge it correctly says 2), Kalos says 0 (while it is 1), Alola says 0 (while it is 2), Galar says 22 (while it is 1), Paldea says 24 (while it is 1, too).








The issue you're facing is due to the way the gameCount is calculated in the RegionsList.js component. The problem arises when the games property of a region is not an array but a single string. In such cases, the length property returns the length of the string, not the count of games.

To fix this, you need to ensure that region.games is always treated as an array before calculating its length. You can use the same approach as before, using Array.isArray() to check if region.games is an array and converting it into an array if it's not.

Here's how you can modify the RegionsList.js component:

useEffect(() => {
  const counts = {};
  pokemonsData.forEach(pokemon => {
    let region = pokemon.region;
    if (!counts[region]) {
      counts[region] = { pokemonCount: 0, gameCount: 0 };
    }
    counts[region].pokemonCount++;
  });
  let pokemons = require('../data/pokemons.json');
  let regions = require('../data/regions.json');
  regions.forEach(region => {
    let pokemonCount = pokemons.filter(pokemon => pokemon.region === region.name).length;
    
    // Ensure region.games is always an array
    let games = Array.isArray(region.games) ? region.games : [region.games];
    let gameCount = games.length;
    
    if (counts[region.name]) {
      counts[region.name].gameCount = gameCount;
    }
  });
  setRegionCounts(counts);
}, []);

This change ensures that the gameCount is always calculated correctly, whether the region.games property is a single string or an array of strings.








Unova do still say 0 (but its 2), Kalos 0 (but its 1), Alola 0 (but its 2).

Galar and Paldea are now fixed. Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh are working correctly since the begin.







The issue you're facing with Unova, Kalos, and Alola regions is likely due to the fact that the region.games property for these regions is not being recognized as an array. This could be because the data for these regions in the regions.json file is not formatted correctly.

To fix this, you should ensure that the games property for each region in your regions.json file is always an array, even if there's only one game. This means that even for regions with one game, the game should be wrapped in square brackets [].

For example, if the games property for the Kalos region is currently a string like this:

"games": "Pokémon X/Y"

You should change it to an array like this:

"games": ["Pokémon X/Y"]

Do this for all regions in your regions.json file. Once you've made these changes, the game count should display correctly for all regions in the RegionsList.js component.







But even using an array, Unova, Kalos and Alola are still showing 0 games.









The issue you're facing with Unova, Kalos, and Alola regions might be due to the fact that the region.games property for these regions is not being recognized correctly in the RegionsList.js component.

The problem seems to be in the way the gameCount is being set in the counts object. The gameCount is only being set if the counts[region.name] object already exists. However, for Unova, Kalos, and Alola, this object might not exist yet when you're trying to set the gameCount.

To fix this, you should ensure that the counts[region.name] object is created for each region before trying to set the gameCount. Here's how you can modify the RegionsList.js component:

useEffect(() => {
  const counts = {};
  pokemonsData.forEach(pokemon => {
    let region = pokemon.region;
    if (!counts[region]) {
      counts[region] = { pokemonCount: 0, gameCount: 0 };
    }
    counts[region].pokemonCount++;
  });
  let pokemons = require('../data/pokemons.json');
  let regions = require('../data/regions.json');
  regions.forEach(region => {
    let pokemonCount = pokemons.filter(pokemon => pokemon.region === region.name).length;
    
    // Ensure region.games is always an array
    let games = Array.isArray(region.games) ? region.games : [region.games];
    let gameCount = games.length;
    
    // Ensure counts[region.name] object exists before setting gameCount
    if (!counts[region.name]) {
      counts[region.name] = { pokemonCount: 0, gameCount: 0 };
    }
    counts[region.name].gameCount = gameCount;
  });
  setRegionCounts(counts);
}, []);

This change ensures that the counts[region.name] object is always created before trying to set the gameCount, which should fix the issue with the game count not displaying correctly for Unova, Kalos, and Alola regions.
