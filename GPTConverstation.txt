components/TypePage.js is returning the following error:

"pokemon.type.toLowerCase is not a function
./src/components/TypePage.js/TypePage/</filteredPokemons<@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:1102:110"

This began happening after the introduction of support to dual-type Pokémons, in other components; probably TypePage.js wasn't updated as well.








It seems that the issue is related to the pokemon.type not being a string. To handle dual-type Pokémons, you need to update the TypePage.js to handle an array of types.

In the TypePage.js, update the filtering logic to handle dual-type Pokémons:

// Filter pokemons by type
const filteredPokemons = pokemonsData.filter(pokemon => {
  const types = Array.isArray(pokemon.type) ? pokemon.type : [pokemon.type];
  return types.some(t => t.toLowerCase() === typeName.toLowerCase());
});
setPokemonsByType(filteredPokemons);

This change will handle both single and dual-type Pokémons, ensuring that the pokemon.type is treated as an array when necessary.
