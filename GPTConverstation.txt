About data/pokemons.json and all other calling it: I want to support dual-type Pokémons like Bulbasaur! So, should use arrays!








Yes, you should use arrays to support dual-type Pokémons like Bulbasaur. To do this, you can modify the "type" field in the pokemons.json file to contain an array of types for each Pokémon that has dual types. For example:

{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Bulbasaur",
  "type": ["Grass", "Poison"],
  ...
}


This will allow you to support dual-type Pokémons effectively.









type.toLowerCase is not a function
PokemonItem@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:745:46

Please tell me all the other pages I should support dual-type!






To support dual-type Pokémons in addition to the TypePage and PokemonItem components, you should also update the PokemonDetails component to handle dual types. Modify the type field in the pokemons.json file to contain an array of types for each Pokémon with dual types. For example:

{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Bulbasaur",
  "type": ["Grass", "Poison"],
  ...
}

Then, update the PokemonDetails component to handle dual types by modifying the type rendering section to handle arrays:

<p>Type: 
  {pokemon.type.map((type, index) => (
    <Link to={`/type/${type}`} key={index} className={`type-badge type-${type.toLowerCase()}`}>
      {getTypeEmoji(type)} {type}
    </Link>
  ))}
</p>

This will allow the PokemonDetails component to properly display dual types for Pokémons like Bulbasaur.










It's not just about PokemonDetails.js, but about PokemonList.js as well!









To support dual-type Pokémons in the PokemonList.js component, you should update the type rendering section to handle arrays:

<div className="pokemon-list">
  {pokemons.map((pokemon, index) => (
    <PokemonItem key={index} {...pokemon} />
  ))}
</div>

This will allow the PokemonList.js component to properly display dual types for Pokémons like Bulbasaur.

It seems that the error "type.toLowerCase is not a function" is occurring in the PokemonItem.js file at line 29. To fix this, you should update the type rendering section in the PokemonItem.js component to handle arrays:

<Link to={`/type/${type[0]}`} className={`type-badge type-${type[0].toLowerCase()}`}>
  {getTypeEmoji(type[0])} {type[0]}
</Link>
{type.length > 1 && (
  <Link to={`/type/${type[1]}`} className={`type-badge type-${type[1].toLowerCase()}`}>
    {getTypeEmoji(type[1])} {type[1]}
  </Link>
)}

This will allow the PokemonItem.js component to properly handle dual types for Pokémons like Bulbasaur.








You did a mess-up here.

Maybe these messings are intentional so I'll run out of the free credits and indirectly forced to subscribe/pay?

Single types (non-dual) like Pikachu now literally display two types: Pikachu is type E and l (first characters of Electric), Charmander is types F and i (first characters of Fire), and so on Squirtle is type W and type a... Please fix that!










It seems that the issue is caused by the rendering of single-character type abbreviations. To fix this, update the getTypeEmoji function in PokemonItem.js to handle dual types and single-character abbreviations properly:

const getTypeEmoji = (type) => {
  if (type.length === 1) {
    return type;
  } else {
    const typeData = pokemonTypes.find((pokemonType) => pokemonType.type === type);
    return typeData ? typeData.emoji : '';
  }
};

This change will ensure that single-character type abbreviations are displayed correctly and that dual types are handled properly in the PokemonItem.js component.








What? Now Pikachu's type is still forcefully dual types "E" and "l", now displayed as "E E" and "l l"!

Pikachu, Charmander and Squirtle has one single type only!

Maybe the solution lies in data/pokemons.json too, as non-Bulbasaur entries weren't updated accounting for arrays?!





The issue with Pikachu, Charmander, and Squirtle displaying dual types "E E", "F F", and "W W" respectively is due to the rendering logic in the PokemonItem.js file. To fix this, update the getTypeEmoji function in PokemonItem.js to handle single types properly:

const getTypeEmoji = (type) => {
  if (Array.isArray(type)) {
    return type.map(t => {
      const typeData = pokemonTypes.find(pokemonType => pokemonType.type === t);
      return typeData ? typeData.emoji : '';
    }).join(' ');
  } else {
    const typeData = pokemonTypes.find(pokemonType => pokemonType.type === type);
    return typeData ? typeData.emoji : '';
  }
};

This change will ensure that single types like Pikachu, Charmander, and Squirtle are displayed correctly as "E", "F", and "W" respectively. This update addresses the issue by properly handling both single and dual types in the PokemonItem.js component.










When I go to Bulbasaur Details page, it goes okay. However, single type Pokémons like Pikachu, Charmander and Squirtle's Details page are displaying this error:

pokemon.type.map is not a function
PokemonDetails@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:584:40






The issue with the single type Pokémons like Pikachu, Charmander, and Squirtle's Details page is due to the rendering logic in the PokemonDetails.js file. To fix this, update the rendering logic to handle both single and dual types:

<p>Type: 
  {Array.isArray(pokemon.type) ? (
    pokemon.type.map((type, index) => (
      <Link to={`/type/${type}`} key={index} className={`type-badge type-${type.toLowerCase()}`}>
        {getTypeEmoji(type)} {type}
      </Link>
    ))
  ) : (
    <Link to={`/type/${pokemon.type}`} className={`type-badge type-${pokemon.type.toLowerCase()}`}>
      {getTypeEmoji(pokemon.type)} {pokemon.type}
    </Link>
  )}
</p>

This change will ensure that the PokemonDetails.js component properly handles both single and dual types for Pokémons like Pikachu, Charmander, and Squirtle.
