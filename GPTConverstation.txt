About components/GamesPage.js: I need to change game to game.name and make game.photo work!

The issue you're facing is due to the fact that you're trying to access properties of game as if it's an object, but in your current implementation, game is just a string (the name of the game).

To fix this, you need to modify your GamesPage component to fetch the game data from games.json instead of regions.json.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Import gamesData from games.json:

import gamesData from '../data/games.json';


2. Replace the games constant with gamesData:

const games = gamesData;


3. Now, you can access the properties of each game object in your map function:

<div className="game-list">{games.map(game => (
    <Link to={`/games/${game.name.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}><div className="game-item">
        <div className="game-photo">
            <img draggable="false" src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/${game.photo}`} alt={game.name} />
        </div>
        <div className="game-info">
            <h3>{game.name}</h3>
        </div>
    </div></Link>
))}


This way, you're correctly accessing the name and photo properties of each game object.
