What's wrong here, differently from PokemonDetails.js? I just want to display Pok√©mon Types (dual type or single type) the same way PokemonDetails.js do!

But ensure "More details" doesn't get modified by your actions; please preserve it!

And without these "pokemon is not defined" errors!


----

Please fix the "More details" item, which isn't clickable anymore!
