In CategoryPage.js line 25: I'm failing to add the category's pokemon count, so I commented out that part.

Please fix and uncomment.






The issue seems to be that you're trying to access categoryPokemons.length but categoryPokemons is not defined in your current scope. You have defined pokemons instead.

You can fix this by uncommenting the line and replacing categoryPokemons.length with pokemons.length. Here's how you can do it:

<center><h2>{category.name}<span className="badge bg-secondary" title={`Total PokÃ©mons in this category: ${pokemons.length}`}>{pokemons.length}</span></h2></center>

This will display the count of pokemons in the current category.
