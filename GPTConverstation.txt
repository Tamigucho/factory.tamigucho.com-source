src/styles/blogger2013.css:
ERROR
Cannot find module './img/blogger2013/bg.png'






The error message you're seeing indicates that the file bg.png in the directory ./img/blogger2013/ cannot be found. This file is likely being referenced in your blogger2013.css file.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the bg.png file exists in the correct location. If the file is missing, you should add it to the ./img/blogger2013/ directory. If the file is in a different location, you should update the path in your CSS file to point to the correct location.

If you're sure that the file is in the correct location and you're still seeing this error, it could be a problem with the way your project is set up. Make sure that your project's configuration is set up to correctly handle image files. For example, if you're using a module bundler like Webpack, you might need to add or adjust a loader for image files.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your project setup and I'll be happy to help further.








It is located in public/img/blogger2013/bg.png. How to declare it in src/styles/other/blogger2013.css?









If your image is located in public/img/blogger2013/bg.png and you want to reference it in your CSS file located at src/styles/other/blogger2013.css, you need to use a relative path from the CSS file to the image file.

Assuming your project structure is like this:

projectRoot
│
├── public
│   └── img
│       └── blogger2013
│           └── bg.png
│
└── src
    └── styles
        └── other
            └── blogger2013.css
            

You would need to go up three directories (../../../) from blogger2013.css to reach the project root, then navigate to public/img/blogger2013/bg.png.

So, in your CSS file, you would reference the image like this:

body {
    background-image: url('../../../public/img/blogger2013/bg.png');
}

This tells the browser to start at the current directory (src/styles/other/), go up three levels to the project root, then navigate down into public/img/blogger2013/ to find bg.png.

Please replace body with the actual CSS selector where you want to apply the background image.
