Please make sure this will always load, for example img/2024/25.svg, from the base URL, and not from the current URL such as the "/type" URL of the TypePage.js.

for example in /type/Electric pointing it is pointing to http://localhost:3000/type/img/2024/25.svg instead of http://localhost:3000/img/2024/25.svg (for Pikachu for example); so please fix that so base URL will always be used.

Using something like "%PUBLIC_URL%/" pointing directly to the base URL /{photo}
