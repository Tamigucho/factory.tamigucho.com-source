About PokemonDetails.js: this is the page showing a Pokémon. So, I need you to add a "previous" and "next" navigation to a pokémon page, showing a left or right arrow to the previous and to the next Pokémon. Example: /Charmander page: Bulbasaur is previous and Squirtle is next. Please add a small photo of the previous and next Pokémons.








To add a "previous" and "next" navigation to the PokemonDetails.js page, you need to modify the component to fetch the previous and next Pokémon based on the current Pokémon's ID.

First, import the useHistory hook from react-router-dom at the top of your PokemonDetails.js file:

import { Link, useParams, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

Then, inside the PokemonDetails component, use the useHistory hook to get access to the history instance:

const history = useHistory();

Next, add two new state variables, prevPokemon and nextPokemon, using the useState hook:

const [prevPokemon, setPrevPokemon] = useState(null);
const [nextPokemon, setNextPokemon] = useState(null);

In the useEffect hook where you fetch the current Pokémon, also fetch the previous and next Pokémon based on the current Pokémon's ID:

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchPokemon = () => {
    const foundPokemon = pokemonsData.find(p => p.name === name);
    setPokemon(foundPokemon);

    const prevPokemon = pokemonsData.find(p => p.id === foundPokemon.id - 1);
    setPrevPokemon(prevPokemon);

    const nextPokemon = pokemonsData.find(p => p.id === foundPokemon.id + 1);
    setNextPokemon(nextPokemon);
  };

  fetchPokemon();
}, [name]);

Finally, add the navigation buttons to the component's render method. Use the history.push method to navigate to the previous or next Pokémon when the corresponding button is clicked:

return (
  <div>
    {prevPokemon && (
      <button onClick={() => history.push(`/${prevPokemon.name}`)}>
        <img src={prevPokemon.photo} alt={prevPokemon.name} />
        Previous
      </button>
    )}
    {nextPokemon && (
      <button onClick={() => history.push(`/${nextPokemon.name}`)}>
        <img src={nextPokemon.photo} alt={nextPokemon.name} />
        Next
      </button>
    )}
    {/* Rest of the component */}
  </div>
);

This will add a "previous" and "next" navigation to the Pokémon details page, with a small photo of the previous and next Pokémon.

ERROR
react_router_dom__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.useHistory is not a function
./src/components/PokemonDetails.js@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:858:77






The error message you're seeing, react_router_dom__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.useHistory is not a function, is likely because you're trying to call the useHistory hook outside of a functional component. Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component.

In the provided code, you're calling useHistory at the top level of your module, outside of any function:

const history = useHistory();

This is incorrect. You should call useHistory inside your PokemonDetails component, like so:

const PokemonDetails = () => {
  const history = useHistory();
  // rest of your code
};

Please make this change and your code should work as expected.

ERROR in ./src/components/PokemonDetails.js 14:18-28
export 'useHistory' (imported as 'useHistory') was not found in 'react-router-dom' (possible exports: AbortedDeferredError, Await, BrowserRouter, Form, HashRouter, Link, MemoryRouter, NavLink, Navigate, NavigationType, Outlet, Route, Router, RouterProvider, 

This error was logged two times, which mean this happened two times so have to be fixed in two places?










The error message export 'useHistory' (imported as 'useHistory') was not found in 'react-router-dom' suggests that the useHistory hook is not being correctly imported from the react-router-dom library.

This could be due to a couple of reasons:

1. You might be using a version of react-router-dom that does not support the useHistory hook. The useHistory hook was introduced in version 5.1.0 of react-router-dom. Please ensure that you are using this version or a later one.

2. The import statement for useHistory might be incorrect. The correct import statement is:

import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

Please ensure that your import statement matches the one above.

The error message being logged twice does not necessarily mean that the error occurred in two different places. It could simply mean that the error occurred twice during the compilation process. However, if you have imported useHistory in multiple files and the import statement is incorrect in all of them, then you would need to fix the import statement in each file.







"react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",

Should I use useNavigation instead of useHistory?







Yes, in react-router-dom version 6.x, the useHistory hook has been replaced with the useNavigation hook.

You can import it from react-router-dom like this:

import { useNavigation } from 'react-router-dom';


Then, you can use it in your component:

const navigation = useNavigation();



To navigate to a different route, you can use the navigate function:

navigation.navigate(`/${prevPokemon.name}`);
navigation.navigate(`/${nextPokemon.name}`);


So, the updated code for your buttons would be:

{prevPokemon && (
  <button onClick={() => navigation.navigate(`/${prevPokemon.name}`)}>
    <img src={prevPokemon.photo} alt={prevPokemon.name} />
    Previous
  </button>
)}
{nextPokemon && (
  <button onClick={() => navigation.navigate(`/${nextPokemon.name}`)}>
    <img src={nextPokemon.photo} alt={nextPokemon.name} />
    Next
  </button>
)}


This will navigate to the previous or next Pokémon when the corresponding button is clicked.

ERROR

I apologize for the confusion, but it seems there was a mistake in my previous response. The useNavigation hook does not exist in react-router-dom v6. Instead, you should use the useNavigate hook.

Here's how you can update your code:

1. Import useNavigate from react-router-dom:

import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';


2. Use the useNavigate hook in your component:

const navigate = useNavigate();


3. Update your navigation buttons to use the navigate function:

{prevPokemon && (
  <button onClick={() => navigate(`/${prevPokemon.name}`)}>
    <img src={prevPokemon.photo} alt={prevPokemon.name} />
    Previous
  </button>
)}
{nextPokemon && (
  <button onClick={() => navigate(`/${nextPokemon.name}`)}>
    <img src={nextPokemon.photo} alt={nextPokemon.name} />
    Next
  </button>
)}


This should resolve the issue you're facing.









Okay, but in http://localhost:3000/Charmander (as for any other Pokémon), I don't see the "Previous" and "Next" buttons!









The "Previous" and "Next" buttons might not be visible due to a couple of reasons:

1. Data Availability: The prevPokemon and nextPokemon are fetched based on the current Pokémon's ID. If the current Pokémon is the first or the last one in the data, the previous or next Pokémon might not exist, respectively. In such cases, the corresponding button will not be rendered.

2. Rendering Condition: The buttons are rendered conditionally based on whether prevPokemon and nextPokemon are not null. If for some reason these variables are not being set correctly, the buttons will not be rendered.

To debug this issue, you can add some console.log statements in your useEffect hook to check the values of prevPokemon and nextPokemon:

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchPokemon = () => {
    // existing code...

    console.log(prevPokemon);
    console.log(nextPokemon);
  };

  fetchPokemon();
}, [name]);


If the console logs show that prevPokemon and nextPokemon are being set correctly, then the issue might be with the rendering of the buttons. Check your JSX to ensure that the buttons are being included in the component's output.

If the console logs show null or undefined for prevPokemon and nextPokemon, then the issue might be with how these variables are being set. Check your fetchPokemon function to ensure that the previous and next Pokémon are being fetched correctly.












"1. Data Availability: The prevPokemon and nextPokemon are fetched based on the current Pokémon's ID. If the current Pokémon is the first or the last one in the data, the previous or next Pokémon might not exist, respectively. In such cases, the corresponding button will not be rendered."

Not the case. The previous for Charmander is Bulbasaur, and the next is Squirtle.

Console log:

Previous Poké: undefined PokemonDetails.js:26
Next Poké: undefined

For Charmander, as example: maybe because the implementation, as Charmander is id 4, expecting the previous to be 3 and next to be 5? But here's the deal: the nextest previous is Bulbasaur, but id 1. The nextest next is Squirtle, but its id is 7.

So I suggest the following feature: when a previous or next id results in an unexisting one, take use of the nextest/closest one.













The issue seems to be with how you're fetching the previous and next Pokémon based on the current Pokémon's ID. If the Pokémon with the previous or next ID does not exist, you're getting undefined.

To fix this, you can modify your fetchPokemon function to find the closest previous and next Pokémon that exist in your data. Here's how you can do it:

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchPokemon = () => {
    const foundPokemon = pokemonsData.find(p => p.name === name);
    setPokemon(foundPokemon);

    const sortedPokemons = [...pokemonsData].sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id);
    const currentIndex = sortedPokemons.findIndex(p => p.id === foundPokemon.id);

    const prevPokemon = sortedPokemons[currentIndex - 1] || null;
    setPrevPokemon(prevPokemon);

    const nextPokemon = sortedPokemons[currentIndex + 1] || null;
    setNextPokemon(nextPokemon);

    console.log("Previous Poké: ", prevPokemon);
    console.log("Next Poké: ", nextPokemon);
  };

  fetchPokemon();
}, [name]);


In this updated code, we first sort the Pokémon data by ID. Then, we find the index of the current Pokémon in the sorted array. The previous Pokémon is then the one at the index before the current Pokémon, and the next Pokémon is the one at the index after the current Pokémon. If the current Pokémon is the first or last one in the array, we get null for the previous or next Pokémon, respectively.

This should ensure that you always get the closest previous and next Pokémon that exist in your data.











Surprisingly, it does work perfectly! Love you!

But there's something more I need from you: add a class to the previous/next buttons, and a CSS ".{that-class} img" to make these previous/next Pokémons' photo to be height:100px.

Also add a previous and a next class to each, so:

Please apply a nice left/right CSS arrow to each if possible, or just use emojis.
The arrow should come before the "Previous" text, and after the "Next" text.







I'm glad to hear that the previous solution worked for you! Now, let's add the classes to the previous and next buttons and apply the CSS styles.

First, add the classes to the buttons in your component:

{prevPokemon && (
  <button className="prev-button" onClick={() => navigate(`/${prevPokemon.name}`)}>
    <img src={prevPokemon.photo} alt={prevPokemon.name} />
    ← Previous
  </button>
)}
{nextPokemon && (
  <button className="next-button" onClick={() => navigate(`/${nextPokemon.name}`)}>
    <img src={nextPokemon.photo} alt={nextPokemon.name} />
    Next →
  </button>
)}


Then, add the following CSS to your theme.css file:

.prev-button img, .next-button img {
  height: 100px;
}

.prev-button {
  /* Add your CSS styles for the previous button here */
}

.next-button {
  /* Add your CSS styles for the next button here */
}


This will apply a height of 100px to the images in the previous and next buttons. You can add additional CSS styles for the buttons in the .prev-button and .next-button classes.

The arrows are added directly in the button text using the Unicode characters for leftwards arrow (←) and rightwards arrow (→). If you prefer to use CSS for the arrows, you can do so by adding ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to the .prev-button and .next-button classes, respectively.
