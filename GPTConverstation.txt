add a /games page (GamesPage.js), listing the games linked by data/regions.json; and a page for games in /games/{game} (GamePage.js) but: remove "&", spaces and similar characteres so get a filtered URL-friendly formatted URL. Will require a data/games.json, containing the game multi-line description and photo in /img/games/{game-url-friendly-name}/boxes.png








To create a /games page and individual game pages, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new file GamesPage.js in the src/components/ directory. This page will list all the games. You can use the regions.json file to get the list of games. Here's a basic structure:

import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import regionsData from '../data/regions.json';

const GamesPage = () => {
  // Get all unique games from all regions
  const games = [...new Set(regionsData.flatMap(region => region.games))];

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Games</h2>
      <ul>
        {games.map(game => (
          <li key={game}>
            <Link to={`/games/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default GamesPage;

2. Create a new file GamePage.js in the src/components/ directory. This page will display details for a specific game. You'll need to create a games.json file in the src/data/ directory with the game descriptions and photos. Here's a basic structure:

import React from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import gamesData from '../data/games.json';

const GamePage = () => {
  const { gameName } = useParams();
  const game = gamesData.find(game => game.name.replace(/&|\s/g, '') === gameName);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{game.name}</h2>
      <img src={`/img/games/${gameName}/boxes.png`} alt={game.name} />
      <p>{game.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default GamePage;

3. Add routes for these new pages in App.js:

import GamesPage from './components/GamesPage';
import GamePage from './components/GamePage';

// Inside <Routes> component
<Route path="/games" element={<GamesPage />} />
<Route path="/games/:gameName" element={<GamePage />} />

Remember to create a README.md file explaining every step necessary to build and put the project to work, as per the instructions.






http://localhost:3000/:
Compiled with problems:
ERROR in ./src/components/GamePage.js 7:0-43
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../data/games.json' in '/home/daniella/com-factory-tamigucho/src/components'











The error message you're seeing indicates that the games.json file cannot be found in the specified path (../data/games.json). This file is required for the GamePage.js component to function correctly.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. Ensure that the games.json file exists in the src/data/ directory. If it doesn't exist, you need to create it.

2. The structure of games.json should be like this:

[
  {
    "name": "Game Name",
    "description": "Game Description",
    "photo": "Game Photo URL"
  },
  ...
]

3. If the games.json file exists and is in the correct location, check the file path in GamePage.js. It should be relative to the location of GamePage.js. If GamePage.js is in the src/components/ directory and games.json is in the src/data/ directory, the path should be ../data/games.json.

If you've followed these steps and are still encountering the issue, please provide more details so I can assist you further.










src/data/games.json - CTRL+K:
Please list all of the games mentioned in the arrays of data/regions.json, such as "Pokémon Red & Blue", "Pokémon Scarlet & Violet", etc.

No need for filling the "description" nor "photo" key of each entry, but the exact name matching the ones found in data/regions.json!

Don't list only Red & Blue and Scarlet & Violet; please do read @regions.json and fill every games found in every "games" key's arrays.


src/data/games.json - CTRL+K:
Don't forget to add empty "description" and "photo" keys after "name" key for every entry!










Please make the games (as in data/regions.json) listed/shown in RegionPage.js clickable, going to /game/{Game}. But remember what I said before: remove "&", spaces and similar characteres so get a filtered URL-friendly formatted URL









To make the games listed in RegionPage.js clickable and link to the corresponding game page, you need to import the Link component from react-router-dom and use it to wrap the game names.

Here's how you can modify the code in RegionPage.js:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

And modify the line where the games are listed:

<ul>{games.map(game => <li key={game}><Link to={`/game/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link></li>)}</ul>

This will replace "&" and spaces in the game names with nothing, creating a URL-friendly string. When clicked, it will navigate to the corresponding game page.

The modified code block is:

const RegionPage = () => {
        ...
        <ul>{games.map(game => <li key={game}>{game}</li>)}</ul>
        <h3>Pokémons  <span className="badge bg-secondary" title={`Total Pokémons in this genre: ${pokemonsByRegion.length}`}>{pokemonsByRegion.length}</span></h3>
        <div className="pokemon-list">

    <PokemonItem key={index} {...pokemon} />
  ))}

      </li>
    ))}
    <li className={`page-item ${currentPage === totalPages ? 'disabled' : ''}`}>

http://localhost:3000/game/Pok%C3%A9monGreen, http://localhost:3000/game/Pok%C3%A9monRedBlue and all others doesn't load.

Also, why "é" is being acceptable instead of "e"?

http://localhost:3000/game/Pok%C3%A9monLet'sGoPikachuLet'sGoEevee:
Why the ' character is being acceptable?




The URLs you're seeing are URL-encoded, which is a standard way of encoding special characters in URLs. The character "é" is encoded as "%C3%A9" and the apostrophe character "'" is not encoded because it is a safe character in URLs according to the RFC 3986 standard.

However, if you want to remove these characters from the URLs, you can modify the replace function in your code to also replace these characters. Here's how you can do it:

In GamesPage.js and RegionPage.js, modify the line where the Link component is used:

<Link to={`/games/${game.replace(/&|\s|é|'/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link>


And in GamePage.js, modify the line where the game is found:

const game = gamesData.find(game => game.name.replace(/&|\s|é|'/g, '') === gameName);

This will replace "&", spaces, "é", and "'" in the game names with nothing, creating a URL-friendly string.

If the pages are still not loading, ensure that the gameName in the URL matches exactly with the game names in games.json. If they don't match exactly (including case sensitivity), the game will not be found and the page will not load.









No, I don't want to remove. Just to point out an inconsistency from you: in App.js you route to games, however in RegionPage.js you're contradicting using /game/ instead of /games/!









I apologize for the inconsistency. You're correct, the routes should be consistent across all components.

In RegionPage.js, the Link component should route to /games/{Game} instead of /game/{Game}. Here's how you can modify the code:

<Link to={`/games/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link>

This change should be made in the following code block:

const RegionPage = () => {
        ...
        <ul>{games.map(game => <li key={game}><Link to={`/game/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link></li>)}</ul>
        <h3>Pokémons  <span className="badge bg-secondary" title={`Total Pokémons in this genre: ${pokemonsByRegion.length}`}>{pokemonsByRegion.length}</span></h3>
        <div className="pokemon-list">
  {currentItems.map((pokemon, index) => (
    <PokemonItem key={index} {...pokemon} />
  ))}
</div>
        <nav aria-label="Page navigation">
  <ul className="pagination">
    <li className={`page-item ${currentPage === 1 ? 'disabled' : ''}`}>
      <a className="page-link" onClick={() => handlePageChange(currentPage - 1)}>Previous</a>
    </li>
    {[...Array(totalPages)].map((e, i) => (
      <li className={`page-item ${i + 1 === currentPage ? 'active' : ''}`} key={i}>
        <a className="page-link" onClick={() => handlePageChange(i + 1)}>{i + 1}</a>
      </li>
    ))}
    <li className={`page-item ${currentPage === totalPages ? 'disabled' : ''}`}>
      <a className="page-link" onClick={() => handlePageChange(currentPage + 1)}>Next</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav> <Dropdown isOpen={dropdownOpen} toggle={toggle}>
  <DropdownToggle caret>

    <DropdownItem onClick={() => setItemsPerPage(50)}>50</DropdownItem>
    <DropdownItem onClick={() => setItemsPerPage(100)}>100</DropdownItem>
  </DropdownMenu>
</Dropdown>

This will ensure that the game links in RegionPage.js route to the correct game pages as defined in App.js






Please, in RegionPage.js, add the Region of the game (as in data/regions.json)!









To add the region of the game in RegionPage.js, you can modify the code where the games are listed. You can use the region.name property to display the region of the game. Here's how you can modify the code:

<ul>{games.map(game => <li key={game}><Link to={`/games/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game} (Region: {region.name})</Link></li>)}</ul>

This change should be made in the following code block:

const RegionPage = () => {
        ...
        <ul>{games.map(game => <li key={game}><Link to={`/games/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link></li>)}</ul>
        <h3>Pokémons  <span className="badge bg-secondary" title={`Total Pokémons in this genre: ${pokemonsByRegion.length}`}>{pokemonsByRegion.length}</span></h3>
        <div className="pokemon-list">

    <PokemonItem key={index} {...pokemon} />
  ))}
</div>
        <nav aria-label="Page navigation">
  <ul className="pagination">
    <li className={`page-item ${currentPage === 1 ? 'disabled' : ''}`}>
      <a className="page-link" onClick={() => handlePageChange(currentPage - 1)}>Previous</a>
    </li>
    {[...Array(totalPages)].map((e, i) => (

        <a className="page-link" onClick={() => handlePageChange(i + 1)}>{i + 1}</a>
      </li>
    ))}

This will display the game name followed by the region name in parentheses.







Oh, sorry. Didn't mean RegionPage.js, but GamePage.js.









To add the region of the game in GamePage.js, you'll need to import the regions.json data and find the region that includes the current game. Here's how you can modify the code:

First, import the regions data:

import regionsData from '../data/regions.json';

Then, find the region of the current game:

const region = regionsData.find(region => region.games.includes(game.name));

Finally, display the region of the game:

<h3>Region: {region.name}</h3>

These changes should be made in the following code block:

startLine: 1
endLine: 18

This will display the region of the game on the game page.





But, please, make that region linkable! Going to /regions/{sample-region}









To make the region linkable in GamePage.js, you can use the Link component from react-router-dom. Here's how you can modify the code:

First, import the Link component:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';


Then, replace the line where the region is displayed with a Link component:

<h3>Region: <Link to={`/regions/${region.name.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{region.name}</Link></h3>

This change should be made in the following code block:

startLine: 1
endLine: 18

This will make the region name a clickable link that navigates to the corresponding region page.


















As of the games URLs (eg. /games/{url-friendly-slug-here}), please fix the /pokemons/{pokemon} URLs; make them work the same way as the games URLs: make them back to be capitalized their original way, but remove these forced "-", dots, spaces, etc.

Look exactly how /games/{game} urls works, and works well, so you'll be able to fix /pokemons/pokemon URLs, principally for Pokemons like Mr. Mime, Mime Jr. and Porygon-Z (whose are stuck at "Loading...")







To fix the /pokemons/{pokemon} URLs to work the same way as the /games/{game} URLs, you need to modify the way the Pokemon names are formatted in the URLs and how they are matched in the PokemonDetails component.

In PokemonList.js and PokemonDetails.js, modify the line where the Link component and useParams hook are used:

// PokemonList.js
<Link to={`/pokemons/${pokemon.name.replace(/\.|-|\s/g, '')}`}>{pokemon.name}</Link>

// PokemonDetails.js
const { name } = useParams();
const pokemon = pokemonsData.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|-|\s/g, '') === name);

These changes should be made in the following code blocks:

startLine: 1
endLine: 20


startLine: 1
endLine: 30


This will replace ".", "-", and spaces in the Pokemon names with nothing, creating a URL-friendly string. When clicked, it will navigate to the corresponding Pokemon page. The Pokemon details will be fetched based on this URL-friendly string.

Remember to create a README.md file explaining every step necessary to build and put the project to work, as per the instructions.






Okay, but, what about App.js routing? No pokemon page is working anymore now.




I apologize for the oversight. You're correct, the routing in App.js also needs to be updated to match the new URL-friendly string format for Pokemon names.

In App.js, modify the line where the Route component for Pokemon details is used:

<Route path={`/pokemons/:name`} element={<PokemonDetails pokemons={pokemons} />} />


This change should be made in the following code block:

function App() {
  ...
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header creatureCount={creatureCount} /> {/* Use the fetched creatureCount */}
      <Search onSearch={handleSearch} />
      <div id="header-wrapper">
<div id="adssection">
<div class="adssection no-items section" id="adssection"></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="header"><div class="widget Header" data-version="1" id="Header1">
<div id="header-inner">
<img draggable="false" alt="Phonemon" height="76px" src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/img/blogger2013/logotype.svg`} width="307px"/>
</div>
</div></div>
<div id="andlogo"></div></div>
<center>
<br/><br/><h5>Digital animals created since 2010 to {lastYear} by <a href="https://danimesq.github.io/" target="_blank">Daniella Mesquita</a>.</h5></center>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<PokemonList pokemons={filteredPokemons} />} />
        <Route path="/creatures" element={<CreaturesPage />} />
        <Route path="/types" element={<TypeList />} />
        <Route path="/types/:typeName" element={<TypePage />} />
        <Route path={`/creatures/:name`} element={<PokemonDetails pokemons={pokemons} />} />
        <Route path="/regions" element={<RegionsList />} />
        <Route path="/regions/:regionName" element={<RegionPage />} />
        <Route path="/games" element={<GamesPage />} />
        <Route path="/games/:gameName" element={<GamePage />} />
        <Route path="/genres" element={<Genres />} />
        <Route path="/genres/:genre" element={<GenrePage />} />
        <Route path="/years" element={<YearsPage />} />
        <Route path="/years/:year" element={<YearPage />} />
        {/* Add more routes as needed */}
      </Routes>
      

This will ensure that the Pokemon details page is correctly routed based on the URL-friendly Pokemon name.









In PokemonList.js at line 24, you've used /pokemons/ instead of /creatures/ !









I apologize for the oversight. You're correct, the routing in PokemonList.js should match with the routing defined in App.js.

In PokemonList.js, modify the line where the Link component is used:

<Link to={`/creatures/${pokemon.name.replace(/\.|-|\s/g, '')}`}>{pokemon.name}</Link>

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonList.js
startLine: 24
endLine: 24

This will ensure that the Pokemon links in PokemonList.js route to the correct Pokemon details page as defined in App.js







Now both http://localhost:3000/creatures/Bulbasaur and http://localhost:3000/creatures/bulbasaur are giving this error:
Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
setPokemon is not defined
./src/components/PokemonDetails.js/PokemonDetails/<@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:1929:9

However, in URLs like http://localhost:3000/creatures/MimeJr, http://localhost:3000/creatures/MrMime and http://localhost:3000/creatures/PorygonZ: page loaded but pokemon details never loading, stuck at "Loading"... for these Pokemons have have spaces, dots or "-" in their original names (Porygon-Z, Mime Jr., Mr. Mime)








The error message "setPokemon is not defined" suggests that the setPokemon function is not defined in the PokemonDetails component. This function is used to set the state of the pokemon variable.

To fix this, you need to uncomment the line where setPokemon is defined in PokemonDetails.js:

//const [pokemon, setPokemon] = useState(null);

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 8
endLine: 8

For the issue with Pokemon names that have spaces, dots, or "-" in their original names, you need to modify the way the Pokemon names are matched in the PokemonDetails component.

Instead of replacing ".", "-", and spaces in the Pokemon names with nothing, you should replace them with the same character ("-") to create a URL-friendly string:

const pokemon = pokemonsData.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s/g, '-') === name);

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 10
endLine: 10

This will ensure that Pokemon names with spaces, dots, or "-" in their original names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.





WHAT?!

With both "const [pokemon" and "const pokemon" in PokemonDetails.js lines 8 and 10, VS Code editor says:
Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'pokemon'.ts(2451)

And browser says:

I apologize for the confusion. You're correct, the variable pokemon is being declared twice, which is causing the error.

To fix this, you should rename the pokemon variable used in the find method to avoid the naming conflict. Here's how you can modify the code:

const foundPokemon = pokemonsData.find(p => p.name.replace(/\.|\s/g, '-') === name);

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 10
endLine: 10

This will ensure that the Pokemon names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.

For the issue with Pokemon names that have spaces, dots, or "-" in their original names, you need to modify the way the Pokemon names are matched in the useEffect hook in PokemonDetails.js.

Instead of replacing ".", "-", and spaces in the Pokemon names with nothing, you should replace them with the same character ("-") to create a URL-friendly string:

const foundPokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => {
  const pokemonNameWithPeriods = pokemon.name.replace(/[\s.]/g, '-').toLowerCase();
  const pokemonNameWithoutPeriods = pokemon.name.replace(/[\s.]/g, '-').replace(/\./g, '').toLowerCase();
  return pokemonNameWithPeriods === originalName.toLowerCase() || pokemonNameWithoutPeriods === originalName.toLowerCase();
});

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 26
endLine: 30

This will ensure that Pokemon names with spaces, dots, or "-" in their original names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.




Why there's two "const foundPokemon" in PokemonDetails.js?

The first one: "'foundPokemon' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)"







The two foundPokemon declarations in PokemonDetails.js are indeed redundant and can cause confusion. The first foundPokemon is declared outside the useEffect hook and is not used anywhere else in the component, which is why you're seeing the "'foundPokemon' is declared but its value is never read" warning.

The second foundPokemon is declared inside the useEffect hook and is used to find the Pokemon that matches the name from the URL. This is the foundPokemon that should be kept.

To resolve this, you should remove the first foundPokemon declaration. Here's how you can modify the code:

// Remove this line
// const foundPokemon = pokemonsData.find(p => p.name.replace(/\.|\s/g, '-') === name);

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 10
endLine: 10

This will remove the unused foundPokemon declaration and resolve the warning.




const foundPokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => {
  const pokemonNameWithPeriods = pokemon.name.replace(/[\s.]/g, '-').toLowerCase();
  const pokemonNameWithoutPeriods = pokemon.name.replace(/[\s.]/g, '-').replace(/\./g, '').toLowerCase();
  return pokemonNameWithPeriods === originalName.toLowerCase() || pokemonNameWithoutPeriods === originalName.toLowerCase();
});

About the above snippet: URLs like /creatures/MimeJr (Mime Jr.), /creatures/MrMime (Mr. Mime) and /creatures/PorygonZ (Porygon-Z) are stuck at the "<div>Loading...</div>". 

Because their Pokémon original names have spaces, dots and hyphens in their names?
HOW THE FUCK TO FINALLY FIX THAT?
All other Pokemon URLs work.
Even URLs like http://localhost:3000/games/Pok%C3%A9monXY, where the original name have spaces and characters like "&", they aren't facing the same issue of not being able to load data.

Please look at PokemonDetails.js to its fullest, and compare with GamesPage.js and GamePage.js






The issue you're facing is due to the way you're handling the Pokemon names in the URL. The Pokemon names with spaces, dots, or hyphens are not being correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.

In the PokemonDetails.js file, you're trying to match the Pokemon name from the URL with the original Pokemon name. However, the original Pokemon name may contain spaces, dots, or hyphens, which are replaced with "-" in the URL-friendly string.

To fix this, you need to modify the way the Pokemon names are matched in the useEffect hook in PokemonDetails.js. Instead of replacing ".", "-", and spaces in the Pokemon names with nothing, you should replace them with the same character ("-") to create a URL-friendly string.

Here's how you can modify the code:

const foundPokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => {
  const pokemonNameWithPeriods = pokemon.name.replace(/[\s.]/g, '-').toLowerCase();
  const pokemonNameWithoutPeriods = pokemon.name.replace(/[\s.]/g, '-').replace(/\./g, '').toLowerCase();
  return pokemonNameWithPeriods === originalName.toLowerCase() || pokemonNameWithoutPeriods === originalName.toLowerCase();
});

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 25
endLine: 29


This will ensure that Pokemon names with spaces, dots, or "-" in their original names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.

As for the comparison with GamesPage.js and GamePage.js, the reason why URLs like http://localhost:3000/games/Pok%C3%A9monXY are not facing the same issue is because the game names do not contain spaces, dots, or hyphens. Therefore, the game names are already URL-friendly and do not need to be modified to match with the URL string.






"As for the comparison with GamesPage.js and GamePage.js, the reason why URLs like http://localhost:3000/games/Pok%C3%A9monXY are not facing the same issue is because the game names do not contain spaces, dots, or hyphens.

Wrong, not true. Take a look at data/games.json: the games do indeed have spaces and special characters like "&".







I apologize for the confusion. You're correct, the game names in games.json do contain spaces and special characters like "&". The reason why the game URLs are working correctly is because the game names are being formatted correctly to create URL-friendly strings in GamesPage.js and GamePage.js.

In GamesPage.js, the game names are formatted using the replace method:

<Link to={`/games/${game.replace(/&|\s/g, '')}`}>{game}</Link>


In GamePage.js, the game names are formatted in the same way:

const game = gamesData.find(game => game.name.replace(/&|\s/g, '') === gameName);

This ensures that the game names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly strings.

For the Pokemon URLs, you need to apply the same formatting to the Pokemon names. In PokemonDetails.js, modify the find method to replace spaces, dots, and "&" with nothing:

const foundPokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|&/g, '') === name);


This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 10
endLine: 10

This will ensure that Pokemon names with spaces, dots, or "&" in their original names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.





Wrong: not line 10, but line 23! foundPokemon should be inside useEffect!

Cursor.so, hey Cursor, you have a lot to learn from all of our conversations some day.

Now Mr. Mime (/creatures/MrMime) and Mime Jr. (/creatures/MimeJr) are fully working!
Except for Porygon-Z (/creatures/PorygonZ). Please remove the "-" so as it is for the "&"









I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're correct, the foundPokemon should be inside the useEffect hook.

To fix the issue with the Pokemon name "Porygon-Z", you need to modify the way the Pokemon names are matched in the useEffect hook in PokemonDetails.js.

Instead of replacing ".", "-", "&", and spaces in the Pokemon names with nothing, you should replace them with the same character ("-") to create a URL-friendly string:

const foundPokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|&/g, '-') === name);

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 25
endLine: 25

This will ensure that Pokemon names with spaces, dots, "-", or "&" in their original names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.





Stop playing dumb! You just broke /MrMime and /MimeJr again!

The "-" should be treated the same way as "." and "&": 
inside "/\.|\s|&/g", and not after the comma in ", ''".






I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're correct, the "-" should be treated the same way as "." and "&".

In PokemonDetails.js, modify the find method to replace ".", "-", "&", and spaces in the Pokemon names with nothing:

const foundPokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === name);

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 25
endLine: 25


This will ensure that Pokemon names with spaces, dots, "-", or "&" in their original names are correctly matched with their URL-friendly string.






Finally, all of the creatures URL-friendly URLs are 100% working! Thank you!

But there's still a issue we're stuck at: the Pokémon evolutions in PokemonDetails.js.

First thing: the evolutions' name are being displayed, but not their photos!





The issue with the Pokemon evolutions' photos not being displayed is likely due to the way the src attribute is being set in the img tag.

In the PokemonDetails.js file, you're setting the src attribute to ${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/${evolution.photo}. However, evolution is a string representing the Pokemon's name, not an object containing the Pokemon's data. Therefore, evolution.photo is undefined.

To fix this, you need to find the Pokemon object that matches the evolution name. Here's how you can modify the code:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name === evolution);
  return (
    <li key={index} class="evolution-item">
      {evolution === pokemon.name ? 
        <mark>
          <img draggable="false" alt={evolution} src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/${evolutionData.photo}`} />
          <h3>{evolution}</h3>
        </mark> 
        : 
        <Link to={`/creatures/${evolution}`.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "-").replace(/\./g, "")}>
          <img draggable="false" alt={evolution} src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/${evolutionData.photo}`} />
          <h3>{evolution}</h3>
        </Link>
      }
      {index < evolutions.length - 1 && ' > '}
    </li>
  );
})}


This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 147

This will ensure that the correct photo is displayed for each Pokemon evolution.






Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
evolutionData is undefined
./src/components/PokemonDetails.js/PokemonDetails/<.children<.children<.children<.children<.children<@http://localhost:3000/main.906bff718604b4c07315.hot-update.js:392:35






The error message "evolutionData is undefined" suggests that the find method is not able to find a Pokemon that matches the evolution name. This could be due to a mismatch between the evolution names and the Pokemon names in the pokemons array.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the evolution names match the Pokemon names exactly. This includes any spaces, dots, or hyphens in the names. If the names do not match exactly, the find method will return undefined, which is why you're seeing the error.

Here's how you can modify the code:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === evolution.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, ''));
  // Rest of the code...
})}


This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 140


This will ensure that the find method can correctly find the Pokemon that matches the evolution name, even if the names contain spaces, dots, or hyphens.





Wrong. Because that resulted in:
Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
evolution.replace is not a function
./src/components/PokemonDetails.js/PokemonDetails/<.children<.children<.children<.children<.children</evolutionData<@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:2234:115





I apologize for the confusion. The error "evolution.replace is not a function" suggests that evolution is not a string. This could be due to the way the evolutions are stored in the pokemons array.

If the evolutions are stored as objects, you should access the name property of the evolution object. If they are stored as strings, you should use the string directly.

Here's how you can modify the code:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionName = typeof evolution === 'string' ? evolution : evolution.name;
  const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === evolutionName.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, ''));
  // Rest of the code...
})}

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 140


This will ensure that the find method can correctly find the Pokemon that matches the evolution name, even if the names contain spaces, dots, or hyphens.





Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
evolutionName is undefined
./src/components/PokemonDetails.js/PokemonDetails/<.children<.children<.children<.children<.children</evolutionData<@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:2235:105






The error "evolutionName is undefined" suggests that the evolution object does not have a name property. This could be due to the way the evolutions are stored in the pokemons array.

If the evolutions are stored as strings, you should use the string directly. If they are stored as objects, you should access the name property of the evolution object. However, if the evolution object does not have a name property, you should handle this case to prevent the error.

Here's how you can modify the code:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionName = typeof evolution === 'string' ? evolution : (evolution && evolution.name ? evolution.name : '');
  const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === evolutionName.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, ''));
  // Rest of the code...
})}


This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 140


This will ensure that the find method can correctly find the Pokemon that matches the evolution name, even if the names contain spaces, dots, or hyphens. It also handles the case where evolution does not have a name property, preventing the "evolutionName is undefined" error.

Instead of giving the same answers, why don't you suggest console.log?




I apologize for the confusion earlier. To better understand the issue, you can add console.log statements to print the evolutionName and evolutionData to the console. This will help you see what values these variables are holding at runtime.

Here's how you can modify the code:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionName = typeof evolution === 'string' ? evolution : (evolution && evolution.name ? evolution.name : '');
  console.log('evolutionName:', evolutionName);
  const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === evolutionName.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, ''));
  console.log('evolutionData:', evolutionData);
  // Rest of the code...
})}


This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 140



By checking the console in your browser's developer tools, you can see the output of these console.log statements. This will help you understand why evolutionData is undefined








Begins to load normally, then suddenly returns empty for evolutionName and undefined for evolutionData.

evolutionName: Charmander PokemonDetails.js:139
evolutionData: 
Object { id: 4, biyearly_id: 4, name: "Charmander", type: "Fire", photo: "./img/2010/4.svg", instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/charmander", description: (2) […], region: "Kanto", biyearly_gen: 1, official_gen: 1, … }
PokemonDetails.js:141
evolutionName: Charmeleon PokemonDetails.js:139
evolutionData: 
Object { id: 5, biyearly_id: 5, name: "Charmeleon", type: "Fire", photo: "./img/2010/5.svg", instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/charmander", description: (2) […], region: "Kanto", biyearly_gen: 1, official_gen: 1, … }
PokemonDetails.js:141
evolutionName: <empty string> PokemonDetails.js:139
evolutionData: undefined








The issue seems to be that the evolutions array contains an empty string, which is causing the find method to return undefined for evolutionData.

To fix this, you can add a check to ensure that evolutionName is not an empty string before trying to find the corresponding Pokemon:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionName = typeof evolution === 'string' ? evolution : (evolution && evolution.name ? evolution.name : '');
  console.log('evolutionName:', evolutionName);
  if (evolutionName) {
    const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === evolutionName.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, ''));
    console.log('evolutionData:', evolutionData);
    // Rest of the code...
  }
})}


This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 140


This will prevent the find method from being called with an empty string, which should resolve the issue.







Should "return (" be inside that "if (evolutionName) {"?




Yes, you're correct. The return statement should be inside the if (evolutionName) block. This ensures that the component only tries to render the evolution items when evolutionName is not an empty string. Here's how you can modify the code:

{evolutions.map((evolution, index) => {
  const evolutionName = typeof evolution === 'string' ? evolution : (evolution && evolution.name ? evolution.name : '');
  console.log('evolutionName:', evolutionName);
  if (evolutionName) {
    const evolutionData = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.name.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, '') === evolutionName.replace(/\.|\s|-|&/g, ''));
    console.log('evolutionData:', evolutionData);
    // Rest of the code...
    return (
      <li key={index} class="evolution-item">
        {evolution === pokemon.name ? 
          <mark>
            <img draggable="false" alt={evolution} src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/${evolutionData.photo}`} />
            <h3>{evolution}</h3>
          </mark> 
          : 
          <Link to={`/creatures/${evolution}`.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "-").replace(/\./g, "")}>
            <img draggable="false" alt={evolution} src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/${evolutionData.photo}`} />
            <h3>{evolution}</h3>
          </Link>
        }
        {index < evolutions.length - 1 && ' > '}
      </li>
    );
  }
})}

This change should be made in the following code block:

src/components/PokemonDetails.js
startLine: 140
endLine: 140

This will prevent the component from trying to render an evolution item when evolutionName is an empty string, which should resolve the issue.





Thank you a lot! Now they do work and display the evolutions' images!




I'm glad to hear that the issue with the evolutions' images has been resolved! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
