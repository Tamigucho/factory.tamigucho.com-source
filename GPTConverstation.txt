To each type (Electric, Grass, etc) in components/TypePage.js, add a type match-ups table (weakness, strenght), with every type shown being clickable to go to their own page as well.

Which mean these data shall be applied to data/pokemonTypes.json as well!











To add a type match-ups table to each type page, you need to modify both the TypePage component and the pokemonTypes.json data file.

First, let's add the match-up data to pokemonTypes.json. Each type object should have two new properties: weaknesses and strengths, both of which are arrays of type names. Here's an example for the "Electric" type:

{
  "type": "Electric",
  "color": "#F8D030",
  "emoji": "âš¡",
  "weaknesses": ["Ground"],
  "strengths": ["Water", "Flying"]
}

Next, modify the TypePage component to display this new data. You'll need to import the pokemonTypes data, find the current type's data, and map over the weaknesses and strengths arrays to create clickable links to each type's page.

Here's a simplified example of how you might do this:

import pokemonTypes from '../data/pokemonTypes.json';

// Inside the TypePage component...
const typeData = pokemonTypes.find(pokemonType => pokemonType.type === typeName);

// In the JSX...
<div className="type-matchups">
  <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
  {typeData.weaknesses.map((weakness, index) => (
    <Link key={index} to={`/type/${weakness}`}>{weakness}</Link>
  ))}

  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  {typeData.strengths.map((strength, index) => (
    <Link key={index} to={`/type/${strength}`}>{strength}</Link>
  ))}
</div>

Remember to add appropriate PropTypes for the new data:

TypePage.propTypes = {
  typeName: PropTypes.string,
  weaknesses: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.string),
  strengths: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.string)
};

Finally, you'll need to add some CSS to style the new type match-ups section. This will depend on your specific design requirements, but here's a basic example:

.type-matchups {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.type-matchups h3 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
.type-matchups a {
  margin-right: 10px;
}

This will create a basic type match-ups table with clickable type names. You can customize this further to fit your specific needs.









http://localhost:3000/type/Electric:

Link is not defined
./src/components/TypePage.js/TypePage/<.children<.children<@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:708:142
TypePage@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:708:42










The error message "Link is not defined" suggests that you're trying to use the Link component from react-router-dom without importing it.

In your TypePage.js file, you should import Link at the top of your file like so:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

This should resolve the error and allow you to use Link to create navigable links in your component.

Remember, whenever you use a component or function from a library in JavaScript, you need to import it at the top of your file. This tells JavaScript where to find the code that defines the component or function.
