TypePage.js: count how many Pokémons are in a type!








To count how many Pokémons are in a type, you can use the following code in the TypePage.js file:

const TypePage = () => {
  // ... (existing code)

  const pokemonsCount = pokemonsByType.length;

  return (
    // ... (existing code)
    <div>
      <p>Total Pokémons in this type: {pokemonsCount}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

This code snippet adds a pokemonsCount variable to calculate the number of Pokémons in the specified type, and then displays it in the component's return statement.
