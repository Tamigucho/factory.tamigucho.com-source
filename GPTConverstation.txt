About App.js: I need changes in how const series and const options work for my ApexChart.

Look at PokemonList.js.

I need App.js' series/data and options/xaxis to reflect the Pokémon years (in options/xaxis) and Pokémon count for a year (series/data).









To reflect the Pokémon years and count in the ApexChart, you need to modify the series and options in App.js to use the data from PokemonList.js.

In PokemonList.js, the Pokémon data is grouped by year. You can use a similar approach in App.js to create the data for the chart.

First, import the Pokémon data at the top of App.js:

import pokemonsData from './data/pokemons.json';

Then, create a new function to group the Pokémon data by year and count the number of Pokémon for each year:

const groupByYear = (data) => {
  return data.reduce((groups, pokemon) => {
    const year = pokemon.year;
    if (!groups[year]) {
      groups[year] = 0;
    }
    groups[year]++;
    return groups;
  }, {});
};

Next, use this function to create the series and options:

const pokemonsByYear = groupByYear(pokemonsData);
const years = Object.keys(pokemonsByYear);
const counts = Object.values(pokemonsByYear);

const series = [{
  name: 'New creatures',
  data: counts
}];

const options = {
  chart: {
    height: 350,
    type: 'line',
  },
  dataLabels: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  xaxis: {
    categories: years,
  },
};

This will create a line chart where the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis represents the count of Pokémon for each year.
