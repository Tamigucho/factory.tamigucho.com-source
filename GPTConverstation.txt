Based in all of that, create the /creatures page, listing all of the Pokémons, as cards so as they are shown in for example /types/Electric and example /years/2010








To create a /creatures page that lists all the Pokémon as cards, you need to create a new component, let's call it CreaturesPage. This component will fetch all the Pokémon data and render them as cards.

Here's a basic example of how you can create this component:

import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import pokemonsData from '../data/pokemons.json';
import PokemonItem from './PokemonItem';

const CreaturesPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="creatures-page">
      {pokemonsData.map((pokemon, index) => (
        <PokemonItem key={index} {...pokemon} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CreaturesPage;

In this code, we're importing the pokemonsData and PokemonItem component. The PokemonItem component is used to render each Pokémon as a card.

Next, you need to add a route for this new page in your App.js file:

import CreaturesPage from './components/CreaturesPage'; // Import the new component

// Inside your Routes component
<Route path="/creatures" element={<CreaturesPage />} />

This will make it so that when you navigate to /creatures, the CreaturesPage component is rendered, showing a list of all Pokémon as cards.

Remember to update all the links in your application that point to the Pokémon details page. For example, if you have a Link component that points to the Pokémon details page, you would change it from:

<Link to={`/${pokemonName}`}>Details</Link>

to:

<Link to={`/creatures/${pokemonName}`}>Details</Link>


This will ensure that when a user clicks on the link, they are taken to the correct URL.








Unconfortable detail: the creatures cards are shown line after line, instead of responsively as they are in /types/{Type} and /years/{Year}









The issue you're facing is likely due to CSS styling. The cards are displayed in a line because they don't have the correct CSS properties to wrap into a new line when the screen width is not enough.

In your /types/{Type} and /years/{Year} pages, the Pokémon cards are probably wrapped in a container with CSS properties similar to these:

.pokemon-list {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

This CSS makes the cards display in a row 1, move to the next line when there's not enough space 2, and distribute the remaining space evenly 3.

To fix the issue in your /creatures page, you need to wrap the Pokémon cards in a container with the same CSS properties. Here's how you can do it:

const CreaturesPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="creatures-page">
      <div className="pokemon-list">
        {pokemonsData.map((pokemon, index) => (
          <PokemonItem key={index} {...pokemon} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

In this code, the pokemon-list class is added to the container that wraps the Pokémon cards. This class should have the necessary CSS properties to make the cards display responsively. If the pokemon-list class is not defined in your CSS, you need to add it with the properties mentioned above.
