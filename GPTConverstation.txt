In App.js' apexchart, there are two <p> elements, and one of them: <p>growth from 2010 to 2024</p>

Please replace "2024" with the last year that have a Pokémon.






To replace "2024" with the last year that has a Pokémon, you need to find the maximum year from your data. You can do this by using the Math.max function on the years array which contains the years of all Pokémon.

Here's how you can do it:

const lastYear = Math.max(...years);

Then, you can use this lastYear variable in your JSX:

<p>growth from 2010 to {lastYear}</p>

So, your updated code will look like this:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// ... other imports ...

function App() {
  // ... other states and effects ...

  const pokemonsByYear = groupByYear(pokemonsData);
  const years = Object.keys(pokemonsByYear);
  const counts = Object.values(pokemonsByYear).map(count => count.toString());
  
  const lastYear = Math.max(...years);

  // ... other code ...

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* ... other components ... */}
      <div class="chartyears">
        <p>new tami creatures:</p>
        <p>growth from 2010 to {lastYear}</p>
        {/* ... other components ... */}
      </div>
      {/* ... other components ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

This will dynamically update the text to show the last year that has a Pokémon.
