"Categories" line in PokemonDetails.js!



To display the categories in the PokemonDetails.js component, you can add a section for categories similar to how types and regions are displayed. Here's the code snippet to add the categories:

<p>Categories: {pokemon.categories.map((category, index) => (
  <Link key={index} to={`/categories/${category}`} className="category-badge">
    {category}
  </Link>
))}</p>

Place this snippet in the appropriate location within the PokemonDetails component, such as after the type or region information. Make sure to style the category-badge class accordingly in your CSS to match the design of your application.

Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
pokemon.categories is undefined
PokemonDetails@http://localhost:3000/main.6e2f79b57878f63ed411.hot-update.js:399:42
renderWithHooks@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:50882:31




The error message indicates that pokemon.categories is undefined, which means that the pokemon object does not have a categories property, or it is not properly initialized before being accessed.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the categories property exists on the pokemon object and that it is an array before trying to map over it. You can add a conditional check before rendering the categories:

{pokemon.categories && (
  <p>Categories: {pokemon.categories.map((category, index) => (
    <Link key={index} to={`/categories/${category}`} className="category-badge">
      {category}
    </Link>
  ))}</p>
)}

This will only attempt to render the categories if pokemon.categories is truthy (i.e., it exists and is not an empty array). If pokemon.categories is undefined or not an array, this section will not be rendered, and you will avoid the runtime error.
