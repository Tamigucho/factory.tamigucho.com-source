- .json pokemon list: try to use real pokedex numbers instead of index!
- Type page: count how much Pokémons are in that type!
- Pokemon Details page: show type matchups of their types, mixing the results of all their types!

- add evolutions! example: https://www.pokemon.com/br/pokedex/raichu, but list these evolutions in each page of that evolutionary line!


- Pokémon types' weaknesses/strenghts aren't accounting for Tamigucho's brand new types, yet
