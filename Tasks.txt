- Type page issue: long spacing between pokemon items, unlike in the start page ; this happens in the start too, when there's an arrow/line with just two poke items
- Type page issue: Pokémon photo isn't being displayed, for example in /type/Electric pointing to http://localhost:3000/type/img/2024/25.svg instead of http://localhost:3000/img/2024/25.svg (for Pikachu)
- Type page: count how much Pokémons are in that type!
- Bug: can't open type/Fighting, where Mankey is
- /type doesn't load; let's make it, showing all of the types! and link it in components/Header.js!
- combo icon next to a multi-type, so show a page of the mix of strenght/weaknesses of that combo!
- include the multi-line descriptions in the search!
- make photos clickable: their URL will open in another tab, kinda like zooming'em!
- example http://localhost:3000/Milcery: make photos smaller, sized 430px width
- Pokemon Details page: show type matchups of their types, mixing the results of all their types!

- add evolutions! example: https://www.pokemon.com/br/pokedex/raichu, but list these evolutions in each page of that evolutionary line!

- react hook for, on every reload, run "npm run count-all-creatures"

- Pokémon types' weaknesses/strenghts aren't accounting for Tamigucho's brand new types, yet
