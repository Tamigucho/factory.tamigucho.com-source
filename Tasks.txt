- TypePage.js issue:: can't open type/Fighting, where Mankey is. Error: "_data_pokemonTypes_json__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.find(...) is undefined
./src/components/TypePage.js/TypePage/<.children<.children<@http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:1181:74". Why?! Because all of the other types are working normally!

- add tags (such as bulb for both bulball and boolb) and make'em searchable!
- include the multi-line descriptions in the search!

- /type doesn't load; let's make it, showing all of the types! and link it in components/Header.js!

- add Home.js page, mv App.js' Pokemons to that
- apexchart: mv apexchart to that Home.js (not anymore appearing globally)
- divide Pokémons by year: Bulb/Char for 2010, Squirtle/Caterpie 2011, Weedle 2012, Pidgey/Rat 2013, Spearow/Ekans 2014, Pikachu 2015, Mankey+Geodude 2016, Gastly+Mr 2017, Porygon 2018, Articuno+Dragonite 2019, Murkrow+Steelix 2020, Porygon2 2021, Shedinja+Rolycoly 2022, Milcery 2023, Nacli 2024
- pokemon count in every year
- reflect years' pokemon count in apexchart!

- make photos clickable: their URL will open in another tab, kinda like zooming'em!
- example http://localhost:3000/Milcery: make photos smaller, sized 430px width
- Pokemon Details page: show type matchups of their types, mixing the results of all their types!

- add evolutions! example: https://www.pokemon.com/br/pokedex/raichu, but list these evolutions in each page of that evolutionary line!

- react hook for, on every reload, run "npm run count-all-creatures"

- Type page issue: long spacing between pokemon items, unlike in the start page ; this happens in the start too, when there's an arrow/line with just two poke items
- Pokémon types' weaknesses/strenghts aren't accounting for Tamigucho's brand new types, yet

- insp https://www.ligapokemon.com.br/?view=pokedex/pokemon&id=932, https://www.ligapokemon.com.br/?view=pokedex/pokemon&id=869

- combo icon next to a multi-type, so show a page of the mix of strenght/weaknesses of that combo!
